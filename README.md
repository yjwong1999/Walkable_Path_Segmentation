# Walkable_Path_Segmentation
Most road surface semantic segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) models avalailable online are trained from a self-driving car's perspective.
This project is meant to train a CNN for **walkable path road segmentation**, which can deployed in an **OpenCV AI Kit with Depth (OAK-D) device**.
